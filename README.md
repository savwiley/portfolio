## Get to Know Me

I graduated with a **Master's in English** in 2017. I got my BA from Louisiana State University of Alexandria & my MA from Southern New Hampshire University.

After working at a newspaper & a mental rehabilitation center, I eventually began to work for home as a Freelance Writer, then an Alternative Text Writer, then inevitably a **Technical Writer**. My Technical Writing began with instructions on how to operate hardware before moving on to troubleshooting. Before I knew it, I was writing for software engineers. This is where my interest in coding began.

In January 2020, I created a **[Dreamwidth Community](https://killthecake.dreamwidth.org/)** only to have a place online to practice learning CSS. When the COVID-19 pandemic began and my work slowed to halt, I dove further into self-learning. Fortunately, my CSS became popular on Dreamwidth, and I found myself taking commissions to build blog layouts and other such things.

During the summer of 2020, I had decided to take coding seriously and was considering going back to school or joining a bootcamp. Then I discovered **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)**. TOP is a non-profit community dedicated to teaching people how to code and prepare them for the job market. Armed with my background in research thanks to my education (and the fact that it was free), I decided to give them a try. I think the results have spoken for themselves. I owe a lot to the TOP community.

At present, I'm extremely excited to start a full-blown career utilizing what was once a hobby and has since become a passion. Really, my love for literature and coding is just about the same. Both require ample amounts of research, both are forms of art in their own way, both can create entire worlds sprouting solely from imagination, and both have the power to change lives. That's precisely why I'm here.

### Fun Facts About Me

- I was born & raised in Louisiana, still living there today.
- I have two dogs & a cat: Hank, Sadie, & Mini respectively.
- I own entirely too much Star Wars merchandise.
- When I started out in coding, I used my CSS skills to raise over $100 for [The Black AIDS Institute](https://blackaids.org/). I've since gotten more popular, which means more charity would take up a lot more time, but I plan to hold another for a different organization in the near future.
- Thanks in part to my education, my brain is stuffed full with useless facts. 
  - Did you know that sperm whales sleep vertically in groups?
  - Or that ancient Romans would flood the Colosseum to perform naval battles?
  - Or that 19th-century astronomers once believed there was a planet between the Sun & Mercury, which they named Vulcan?
- To the constant exasperation of my mother, I also really love puns.
  - What are windmills' favorite music genre? They're big metal fans.
