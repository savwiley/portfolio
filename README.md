## Some Projects I'm Proud Of

- [Where's Waldo?](https://github.com/savwiley/waldo) - A Where's Waldo-esque game where players find different pop culture characters. Complete with varying difficulties & high score tables. Made with ReactJS, React-Router, & Firebase.

- [Battleship](https://github.com/savwiley/battleship) - A real game of Battleship you can play against an AI. Place your ships, load your boards, & annihilate the enemy! Made with ReactJS & React-Router.

- [Mock Retail Site](https://github.com/savwiley/shopping-cart) - A fake retail website that displays products filtered by category, allows users to navigate to each product's own page, & gives options to buyers for adding a certain quantity to their shopping cart! Users can change quantities or remove items as they see fit. Made with ReactJS & React-Router.

- [Memory Game](https://github.com/savwiley/memoryCard) - Play a game of memory! Select various MCU posters from the options provided but don't click on the same one twice. Pick all 15 and you win! Features a user's personal high score so they can battle against themselves. Made with ReactJS.

- [The Library](https://github.com/savwiley/libraryProject) - A universal library for users to add their own books and save them to a server.

- [Weather App](https://github.com/savwiley/weather) - A real weather app with all the bells and whistles (except a working radar)!

There's also an option to view the temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius. Made with JavaScript & Webpack.
