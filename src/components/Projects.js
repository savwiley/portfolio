            This app was made with ReactJS, React-Router, & Firebase. It was one of the first I created using Firebase, and so I learned how to use it, Firestore, & other Firebase features. The app includes three difficulty settings, a high scores table based on time taken to find all the characters, and the option to submit your score anonymously (by assigning you a random Pok√©mon name). It also shows the most recent scores in each difficulty setting. The artwork used in this app was created by <a

          <div>
            This Battleship game was made with React & React-Router. Though it wasn't the first project I used a testing framework on, it was the first time I used Jest & integrated testing so thoroughly into a project. This app allows players to place their own ships and play against an AI. It features an info board to keep players up to date on the computer's latest move and a small wait time while the computer is "thinking" about its next move, making the opponent seem a little more real and the game more fluid.

Users can submit/edit quantities and push their desired items to their shopping cart. The cart itself shows the total amount of items and allows users to delete products from their cart if they desire.

            The memory game was made with React & was one of the first projects I ever used it on. This game taught me how to use custom hooks & object arrays with React. Here, the user clicks on images they haven't clicked on before, forcing them to remember 15 different images. The images I chose were various Marvel Cinematic Universe posters. If a user loses, their score (if higher than their previous scores) is set as their high score. If they can get through all 15 images, they win.

            The Library was initially an older project that taught me how to use webpack. Originally, it kept a user's books stored on their browser's local storage where they could set if they read particular books or not. However, I have since gone back and refactored the code to add Firebase. Now, The Library is a universal one, always remembering new inputs & allowing users to put in whatever books they desire. They can also share which books they have read or sort through the current list of books in whatever way they desire. Feel free to take a look & add your own list of books.

It features the current weather in any major city in the world, while also displaying future predictions for the next few hours to next few days, accurate icons to depict the predicted weather, country flags of all cities, & the option to view temperatures in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
